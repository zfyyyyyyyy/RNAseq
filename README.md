# RNAseq
Study on the differential genes of rice varieties with significant differences in nitrogen use efficiency under high nitrogen fertilizer application during the three-leaf stage; 
The data comes from the literature 'Genome-wide identification of the peptide transporter family in rice and analysis of the PTR expression modulation in two near-isogenic lines with different nitrogen use efficiency'; 
The RNA-seq data downlode from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with the accession code PRJNA573824;
